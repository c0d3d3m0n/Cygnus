Cygnus - A Web Reconnaissance FrameworkStatus: üöß Under Development üößCygnus is a powerful and intuitive web application framework designed to streamline and automate the process of web reconnaissance. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for both active and passive information gathering, all accessible through a clean, modern web interface. This project aims to centralize common recon tasks, making it an essential tool for security professionals, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters.üìã Table of ContentsAbout The ProjectKey FeaturesTech StackGetting StartedPrerequisitesInstallationUsageRoadmapContributingLicenseüìñ About The ProjectIn the initial phase of any security assessment, reconnaissance is critical. Gathering information about a target can be a time-consuming process, often involving multiple disparate tools. Cygnus was created to solve this problem by integrating a variety of recon tasks into a single, cohesive platform. By leveraging a robust backend and a reactive frontend, Cygnus allows users to manage, execute, and review reconnaissance scans efficiently.The asynchronous task management system ensures that even long-running scans (like directory bruteforcing or extensive port scanning) can be performed without blocking the user interface, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.‚ú® Key FeaturesCygnus is being built with a range of features to cover the reconnaissance lifecycle:Passive ReconnaissanceWHOIS Lookup: Retrieve registration data for a domain.DNS Lookup: Query various DNS records (A, MX, TXT, etc.).Certificate Lookup: Inspect SSL/TLS certificate details and transparency logs.Shodan Enumeration: Integrate with the Shodan API to find exposed devices and services.Active ReconnaissancePort Scanning: Identify open ports on a target host.Directory Bruteforcing: Discover hidden files and directories on a web server.Subdomain Finding: Enumerate subdomains associated with a target domain.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackCygnus is built with a modern and scalable technology stack:Backend: Django & Django REST FrameworkFrontend: React.jsDatabase: PostgreSQLAsynchronous Tasks: CeleryMessage Broker: RedisüöÄ Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a local copy of Cygnus up and running for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesYou will need the following installed on your system:Python 3.8+Node.js & npmPostgreSQLRedisInstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/cygnus.git](https://github.com/your-username/cygnus.git)
cd cygnus
Backend Setup:Create and activate a virtual environment:python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Python dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your .env file for database credentials and other settings (copy from .env.example).Run database migrations:python manage.py migrate
Frontend Setup:Navigate to the frontend directory:cd frontend
Install Node.js dependencies:npm install
Run the Application:Start the Backend Server:python manage.py runserver
Start the Frontend Development Server: (in the frontend directory)npm start
Start Redis and Celery: (in separate terminals)redis-server
celery -A cygnus_project worker -l info
üñ•Ô∏è UsageOnce the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. From the dashboard, you can select a target and choose which reconnaissance tasks you want to perform. The results will be displayed in real-time as the tasks complete.(More detailed usage instructions and screenshots will be added as the project matures.)üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap[ ] Implement user authentication and multi-user support.[ ] Develop a project/target management system.[ ] Add reporting and data export features (PDF, CSV).[ ] Integrate more third-party APIs (e.g., VirusTotal, Hunter.io).[ ] Enhance visual data representation with charts and graphs.[ ] Dockerize the entire application for easier deployment.See the open issues for a full list of proposed features and known bugs.üôå ContributingContributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.
