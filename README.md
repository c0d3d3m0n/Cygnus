# Cygnus - A Web Reconnaissance Framework

🚧 **Status:** Under Development 🚧  

Cygnus is a powerful and intuitive web application framework designed to streamline and automate the process of **web reconnaissance**. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for both **active** and **passive** information gathering, all accessible through a clean, modern web interface.  

This project aims to centralize common recon tasks, making it an essential tool for **security professionals, penetration testers, and bug bounty hunters**.

## 📖 About The Project
In the initial phase of any security assessment, reconnaissance is critical. Gathering information about a target can be a **time-consuming process**, often involving multiple disparate tools.  

**Cygnus** was created to solve this problem by integrating a variety of recon tasks into a **single, cohesive platform**.  

Key highlights:
- **Robust backend** with asynchronous task handling.  
- **Reactive frontend** for a smooth user experience.  
- **Seamless task management**, ensuring long-running scans (e.g., directory bruteforcing, port scanning) don’t block the UI.

## ✨ Key Features

### Passive Reconnaissance
- **WHOIS Lookup** → Retrieve domain registration data.  
- **DNS Lookup** → Query A, MX, TXT, and other DNS records.  
- **Certificate Lookup** → Inspect SSL/TLS certificates and transparency logs.  
- **Shodan Enumeration** → Integrate with Shodan API for exposed devices & services.  

### Active Reconnaissance
- **Port Scanning** → Identify open ports on target hosts.  
- **Directory Bruteforcing** → Discover hidden files & directories.  
- **Subdomain Finding** → Enumerate subdomains of a target domain.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery  
- **Message Broker:** Redis

redis-server

# Celery worker
celery -A cygnus worker -l info
```

🖥️ Usage

Once running, open your browser at http://localhost:3000
From the dashboard you can:
Select a target.
Launch active/passive reconnaissance tasks.
View results in real-time as scans complete.
(Detailed usage instructions & screenshots will be added as the project matures.)

🗺️ Roadmap
 Implement user authentication & multi-user support.
 Add project/target management system.
 Generate reports (PDF, CSV).
 Integrate APIs like VirusTotal, Hunter.io.
 Visual dashboards with charts & graphs.
 Dockerize for streamlined deployment.
